npm start
```

**Make a Prod Build**

```sh
npm build
```

## How to Use this Course

This Repo contains a few courses. They are best when worked through in order.

The courses are found by branch refs; they follow the pattern "course/part-1/start" and "course/part-1/finish". To get an idea of what you are working toward, jump to the `*/finish` branch to see the end result. Play around with the result in your browser. Then when you are ready, jump back to the `*/start` branch and work through the commits toward `*/finish`.

Good Luck!
